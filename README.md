# Currencies
There are 6 currencies in the game that are used to buy buildings. You get these currencies by clicking, but they are very rare. All currencies are listed here:
- Money
- Golden Shards (0.002%)
- Diamond Shards (0.000004%)
- Emerald Shards (0.000000008%)
- Ruby Shards (0.000000000016%)
- Mystical Shards (0.000000000000032%)
Each currency is 500 times more rare than the last one. Every time a building gets its cps added, so there is a chance of you getting Mystical Shards in the late-game.
